Welcome to my website! My name is Adam. I'm a software engineer currently working at AWS developing the software that powers the cloud.
I'm a huge nerd, interested in all things science or technology. I mainly do backend development, with a touch of front-end for my personal projects.
I am currently very interested in cloud and distributed computing, and I am working every day to learn more.
Please have a look around my website to learn more!
